# Furcadia Launcher
A variant launcher for Furcadia written in Common Lisp and (in the future) CommonQt/Qt4.

## Goals
  * Ability to launch Furcadia from command line for any given character, skipping the official launcher. (DONE)
  * Ability to edit descriptions and other attributes as pure text.
  * Ability to show arbitrary images when a given character is selected.
  * Ability to mix characters from different mail accounts on a single list.
  * Ability to automatically refresh characters to prevent them from expiration.

## Mockup
Don't get too excited - it's just a mockup so far, but that's how I imagine the main screen of the launcher to be modeled.
